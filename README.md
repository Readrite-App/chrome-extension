# How to Install the Extension

1. Download this repository.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` in Google Chrome.

1. In the upper right-hand corner of the page, toggle **Developer Mode** to be **ON**.

1. In the uppper left-hand corner of the page, click **Load unpacked**.

1. Navigate to the `highlighter-master/` folder that you downloaded and **Select** it.

The extension should now be installed!

The highlighting can be kind of annoying on certain websites, so I would recommend only enabling the extension for specific websites by right-clicking the icon in your Chrome toolbar and choosing to enable it for specific sites.
